// FnOnce applies to closures that can be called once, all closures implement at least this trait
// because all closures can be called.
// FnMut applies to closures that don't move captured value out of their body, but might mutate the
// captured values.
// Fn applies to closures that don't move captured value and don't mutate the captured value as well
// as capture nothing from their environment.
